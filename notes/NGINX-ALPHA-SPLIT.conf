# Dexter NGINX Overview

## Live Config Backups (see `ops/nginx-sites/`)
- `dexter.cash.conf` – primary site plus MCP/OAuth proxy rules and pump dashboard
- `api.dexter.cash.conf` – REST/GraphQL API reverse proxy on :3030
- `mcp.dexter.cash.conf` – dedicated MCP HTTP proxy on :3930

These files are pulled directly from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` whenever we refresh them. Update the copies after making changes in production so the repo stays authoritative.
