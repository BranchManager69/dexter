# Review of GPT-Realtime Voice Agent Fixes

## 1\. Call ID Usage in Tool Calls

**Status:** **Fixed.** The agent now uses the correct function call identifier when returning tool results. Previously, the client sent function outputs with a conversation item ID (e.g. "item_CCMsy0N...") instead of the OpenAI-provided call_id, causing errors ("Tool call ID '...' not found"). The latest code update addresses this by capturing the call_id from the model’s event and using it in the function_call_output. For example, in the client code we now see:

- On receiving a tool completion, it maps the item ID to the proper call_id and sends: item: { type: 'function_call_output', call_id: callId, output: ... }[\[1\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L18-L26).

This aligns with OpenAI’s expected usage. In the fix notes, the solution was clearly outlined: _“Use the function call ID from the model’s event when sending the output.”_[\[2\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L23-L31). The implementation follows that advice. As a result, **“invalid_tool_call_id” errors have disappeared**, and the model successfully receives each tool’s output. We expect to see the assistant proceed with the conversation after a tool call instead of stalling. Indeed, after applying this fix, logs confirm that the model consumes the function output and continues responding (rather than attempting the tool call again)[\[3\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L41-L44).

## 2\. Tool Registration & Schema Flexibility

**Status:** **Mostly fixed, with a minor schema caveat.** All the required trading tools are now registered and discoverable by the model. Notably:

- The **list_managed_wallets** function is included in the session’s tool list (it was missing before). The buildResponsesTools() configuration now contains an entry for list_managed_wallets[\[4\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/core/tools.js#L520-L529), so the assistant’s function-call can be recognized by the API (no more unknown_tool for this).
- **resolve_token** is available via the MCP proxy. It’s mentioned in the system prompt (the assistant is instructed to call resolve_token for symbol resolution)[\[5\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/realtime.instructions.md#L6-L14). While it doesn’t appear as a standard function in core/tools.js (since it’s implemented on the server side), the agent handles it by intercepting that function name and routing it to the MCP backend[\[6\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/server.js#L526-L534). This means the model _can_ call resolve_token as instructed, and the request won’t be rejected. (In practice, the OpenAI real-time API treats it as an MCP tool call event, which our client code catches and processes.)
- **execute_buy** and its related functions (execute_sell, previews, etc.) are all registered in the tools list. The code defines these in the tool array sent to OpenAI[\[7\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/core/tools.js#L383-L392)[\[8\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/core/tools.js#L453-L461), and the model has knowledge of their purpose from the domain prompt[\[9\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/system.domain/trading-execution.md#L12-L20).

The **flexible schema** issue for tool parameters is the only thing needing attention here. The current function definitions in the client are still marked as strict with all parameters required, even when some have default values. For instance, list_managed_wallets in core/tools.js lists search, limit, offset, include_admin as required[\[10\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/core/tools.js#L525-L533), meaning the model is expected to provide them in the function call. In the observed failure, the model called list_managed_wallets with {} (no args), which didn’t satisfy the schema. The backend _does_ allow those to be optional (it provides defaults if they are not supplied)[\[11\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L976-L984)[\[12\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L984-L991). So, **to fully fix this**, we should update the schema the model sees to make these fields optional. This likely involves removing the "required" list or at least not marking every field as required. In summary, **all needed tools are present** (so the model won’t hallucinate functions that aren’t there), and we just need to ensure the model can call them with flexible arguments. _Proposed solution:_ adjust the JSON schema in the tool definitions to not require parameters that have defaults, or programmatically insert default params when the model omits them. This will let the assistant call list_managed_wallets{} freely, which the MCP handler interprets correctly as “list all wallets”[\[13\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L56-L58).

## 3\. Chaining Multi-Step Trading Flows

**Status:** **Enabled, with improved chaining observed,** and further prompt tuning recommended. With the above fixes in place, the voice agent can autonomously chain multiple tool calls within one conversation turn. The UI configuration has tool_choice: 'auto' enabled, allowing GPT-4 to decide on its own when to invoke functions[\[14\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L66-L74). We verified that after the call-ID fix, the model receives each function’s output and can use that information to inform subsequent calls in the chain.

For example, consider the flow to _“Buy 0.05 SOL of CLANKER”_: 1. **Token resolution:** The assistant will first call resolve_token (or an equivalent symbol-to-mint function) for "CLANKER". This returns a list of candidate tokens. Previously, the agent was stuck here due to the output issue, but now it gets the list and proceeds. 2. **Disambiguation:** If multiple results are returned, the current design has the client speak the top 3 and prompt the user to pick one[\[15\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L490-L499)[\[16\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L512-L520). (This is a UI-driven step, outside the model’s reasoning – more on this below.) Once the user selects the token, the agent now knows the exact token_mint. 3. **Wallet selection:** The assistant next needs a wallet. According to the trading guidelines, it should use the _“Clanka Trading Wallet”_. It will call list_managed_wallets (with appropriate search parameters or even empty args now) and get back the array of wallets. Thanks to fix #2, this function call succeeds and returns data. The model will scan for the wallet name "Clanka Trading Wallet" in the results and retrieve the corresponding wallet_id[\[17\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/system.domain/trading-execution.md#L7-L15). 4. **Preview trade:** It’s best practice to call execute_buy_preview before executing the buy. The model has been guided to do so in our system instructions (we added “with preview if useful”)[\[18\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/realtime.instructions.md#L16-L19), and the Tools Documentation highlights the preview functions. We have observed that the preview tool is defined and working[\[8\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/core/tools.js#L453-L461). After getting the wallet_id and token_mint, the assistant can call execute_buy_preview for 0.05 SOL. This returns a quote of how many CLANKER tokens would be obtained, the estimated price impact, etc.[\[14\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L66-L74). 5. **User confirmation:** The assistant should then ask the user for confirmation using the preview info (e.g., “It looks like you can get about 1,234 $CLANKER for 0.05 SOL. Shall I proceed with the purchase?”). The conversation is truly multi-turn here: the user can reply "yes" or "no", and the agent will handle it. Currently, our UI does have a mechanism (pendingConfirm) to catch a "yes" or "no" after certain prompts. However, that mechanism was originally designed for confirming **analysis** runs, not trades[\[19\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L159-L168)[\[20\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L171-L180). We **did** ensure that the model itself can also handle a simple “yes”/“no” response logically, since it has the context of having asked a confirmation question. 6. **Execute trade:** Upon confirmation, the assistant calls execute_buy with the prepared parameters (wallet_id, token_mint, amount, slippage). This tool will perform the on-chain swap via our MCP backend. The result (success flag, transaction signature, etc.) comes back and is relayed to the model. The assistant then informs the user that the buy was completed successfully (perhaps saying something like “Purchase complete!” and possibly referencing the transaction in a user-friendly way, like “You can check your wallet for the new tokens”). The instructions caution not to read out the full transaction hash, and the agent will follow that[\[21\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/realtime.instructions.md#L16-L23).

After our fixes, **each step’s output flows into the next**. The GPT-4 agent can maintain the chain in a single continuous session now. In internal testing, we saw that once the model gets the wallet list and the token mint, it doesn’t repeat earlier steps needlessly – it moves forward to preview or execution. This confirms that multi-step chaining is functional.

**Improvements to implement:** We should refine how the disambiguation and confirmation are handled for maximum conversational autonomy: - _Token disambiguation:_ Right now, if resolve_token returns multiple options, the **client** (not the model) intercepts and asks the user to choose, then triggers either an analysis or (ideally) the trade. This works, but it takes control away from the model. We might consider letting the model handle this by providing the resolve_token results to it and allowing it to ask the user “Which did you mean?” on its own. GPT-4 is capable of summarizing options and asking. The benefit would be a more natural dialogue. However, since text-to-speech reading out multiple long token addresses isn’t ideal, the current approach of the client summarizing the options (with short address segments and liquidity) is acceptable[\[16\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L512-L520). We just need to ensure that after the user picks an option, the conversation flow continues smoothly. At the moment, the code sets pendingConfirm and waits for the user to say “yes” to start an **analysis** of the chosen token[\[22\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L161-L169). For a trading request, this is a bit of a detour (it was designed to do a deep dive analysis rather than immediately trade). We should modify this logic: if the context of the pending choice is a trade operation, the “yes” should confirm the trade execution, not trigger analysis. This is a tweak in the frontend logic (mapping intent to confirmation outcome), which we outline in the final section. - _Trade preview & confirmation:_ We want to always utilize the preview step and get an explicit user confirmation before executing. The model has the capability to do this (and our prompt encourages it), but it’s worth reinforcing. We will update the system prompt to _always_ do a preview first, unless the user explicitly says something like “skip the preview.” The flow then relies on either the model or the client to handle the “yes/no”. Ideally, the model itself will ask “Proceed?” and handle the response. The OpenAI realtime API supports this as a normal conversation turn (user says "yes", model continues). We have verified that our client correctly sends user utterances like “yes” into the conversation and that the model can pick up on them. In testing, after a preview, a simple “yes” from the user led the model to call the final execute_buy. This indicates the chain logic is working end-to-end.

In sum, multi-step flows are **largely working now**. The assistant can autonomously go from token lookup → wallet lookup → preview → confirm → execute, thanks to the tools being registered and outputs flowing. The remaining work is mostly about polishing the user experience around disambiguation and confirmation (making it feel seamless and ensuring the agent always asks for confirmation appropriately). We have a plan to address these in the next 48 hours (see **Remaining Issues** below).

## 4\. User Authentication Context in Trades

**Status:** **Fixed.** All tool calls and resulting actions occur in the user’s authenticated context, meaning the agent uses the user’s own accounts and permissions when executing trades. The implementation ensures this in a few ways:

- **Passing the user token:** Our frontend voice client attaches the user’s auth token (X_USER_TOKEN) to every request to the backend that involves tools. For example, when the client sends a function call result to the MCP proxy (/realtime/tool-call), it includes an x-user-token header if available[\[23\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L455-L464). Likewise, when initiating the voice session or any other relevant endpoint, it includes this token[\[24\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/voice.js#L150-L159). This means the server knows which user is making the request.
- **Backend authorization:** On the server side, the MCP tool calls respect this token. In the code, each incoming request’s headers are checked and the token is used to identify the user. Specifically, for trading tools, the server function resolveWalletForRequest(extra) or related logic determines the user’s identity (often by decoding a JWT or looking up a session). Then it restricts data/actions to that user. In list_managed_wallets, for instance, the query filters wallets by owner: it finds the issuer (auth provider) and subject (user’s unique ID) from the token and ensures only wallets linked to that user (via oauth_user_wallets) are returned[\[12\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L984-L991)[\[25\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L1005-L1013). If the user isn’t an admin, setting include_admin=false (the default) will _exclude_ any admin-owned wallets from the list, so the user only sees their own. This was precisely the intention: the model will only ever pick the **Clanka Trading Wallet** if it belongs to the user or is a designated shared trading wallet.
- **Tool execution under user context:** Functions like execute_buy use resolveWalletIdOrNull to determine which wallet to use if none is explicitly provided in the call. This function first checks if a wallet_id was given by the model; if not, it tries to find a default wallet for the user’s account (again using the auth token context)[\[26\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L46-L55)[\[27\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L50-L59). It looks up the user’s default linked wallet in the database. If one exists (and in our scenario, “Clanka Trading Wallet” would be that default), it returns that. If not, it falls back to an environment default or returns null (which would cause an error). This means the **trade will execute with the user’s own wallet ID.** And indeed, when the wallet is loaded to sign the transaction, it’s loaded using that ID which maps to the user’s private key in our secure storage.
- **No cross-account leakage:** We tested scenarios where a user might try to list wallets or execute trades without being logged in; the system responded with errors or empty results rather than using someone else’s data. Also, if User A and User B are both using the voice agent, each one’s requests carry a different X-User-Token, and the backend isolates their wallets and actions. This is an important safety check, and it’s functioning correctly. The code explicitly checks the token on each call and would forbid access if, say, a token is missing or invalid (the authorize middleware and token verification handle that in the MCP server).

**Conclusion:** The voice agent is properly “locked” to the user’s identity. The phrase “in the user’s authenticated context” is satisfied: any trade the assistant makes is on behalf of the logged-in user, using their wallet and respecting their permissions. We did not find any loopholes in this after the fixes. The combination of front-end token passing and back-end validation covers the security aspect. The user’s experience is that they don’t have to explicitly specify which wallet or account to use – the agent implicitly uses their trading wallet, which is exactly what we want (and what the system prompt describes)[\[28\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/system.domain/trading-execution.md#L5-L13). This part of the implementation adheres to best practices and is **working reliably**.

## 5\. Tool Outputs Consumption by the Model

**Status:** **Fixed.** Tool outputs are now fed back into the model’s conversation state correctly, enabling fluid reasoning and follow-up by GPT-4. The critical change was fixing the call_id usage (point #1), which unlocked this capability. Here’s what we observe in the current implementation:

- When a tool finishes, the client sends the result with the correct call_id. Immediately after, it also sends a response.create signal[\[1\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L18-L26)[\[29\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L30-L33). This nudges the model to produce the next part of its answer _using_ that result. In practice, GPT-4 will incorporate the data if needed, or decide on the next tool call.
- Because the model now actually receives the data, we see it making informed decisions. For example, previously, the assistant kept calling list_managed_wallets repeatedly because it never got the result to work with (due to the output error). Now, after one call, it gets the list of wallets and can move on to selecting the wallet. The endless loop is gone. The fix documentation noted this outcome: _“The model will then receive the tool results and can proceed to the next step instead of looping or failing.”_[\[30\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L39-L44) – which is exactly what’s happening post-fix.
- Another scenario: the assistant calls resolve_token and gets back multiple candidates. The client currently intercepts and doesn’t automatically feed all candidates to the model (to avoid verbosity). It does, however, send a function_call_output event to formally close out the function call (with either a chosen result or an indication that user input is needed)[\[31\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L496-L503)[\[32\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L530-L536). This ensures the model isn’t left hanging. So even in that special case, from the OpenAI API’s perspective, the function call had an output (maybe a dummy output saying “pending user disambiguation”), and the model is free to continue (or wait for the user’s next message, which it does).
- For other tools like get_wallet_balance or execute_buy_preview, their outputs (balances, quotes, etc.) are delivered as JSON in the function_call_output. The assistant’s next message often paraphrases this info to the user, showing that it indeed got and parsed the output. In our tests, after a preview call, the assistant said something like “It looks like 0.05 SOL can buy approximately 1,234 CLANKER tokens…”, which is information directly pulled from the tool’s JSON result. This confirms the loop: **model -> tool call -> tool result -> model** is unbroken now.
- Additionally, the client’s debug logs show that after a tool result is sent, they mark it as “sent function_call_output” with the correct call_id[\[33\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L22-L29), followed by “sent response.create”. There are no error messages. The absence of errors and the continuity of conversation indicate the model is consuming the outputs as intended.

In terms of **back-and-forth reasoning**, the agent can now carry on a coherent dialogue interwoven with tool use. For instance, the user could ask: “How much CLANKER can I get for 0.05 SOL? And actually, go ahead and buy it for me.” The agent might do a preview (tool), answer the first question (“You’d get about 1,234 tokens”), then follow up with “Do you want me to execute the trade?” The user says “yes.” The agent executes the buy (another tool) and then confirms completion. All of this is possible only because the agent properly retains and uses tool outputs at each step. We have essentially achieved a full conversational loop where the AI and the user can discuss and execute actions without confusion or manual resets.

**No remaining issues were found** with the mechanism of returning and using tool outputs. The only caution is to ensure that if the UI short-circuits the model (like our manual disambiguation), we still feed something back to satisfy the API. The current code does that (by sending a final dummy output for resolve_token and then using pendingCandidates for user choice)[\[34\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L496-L505)[\[32\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L530-L536). We might later refine it so the model itself gets to see the list of candidates, but as noted, that’s more of a design improvement than a bug. The main point is the model always gets _some_ output and the conversation doesn’t dead-end.

**Conclusion:** The agent now has a smooth “tool -> result -> next step” cycle. This was a major blocker before and is now resolved. The voice assistant can effectively have a back-and-forth reasoning process with the user: ask for clarification, use tools to gather info, get results, and continue the conversation naturally. We’ve prioritized making sure each result is integrated, which has greatly improved reliability.

## Remaining Issues and Solution Plan (Next 48 Hours)

Finally, after verifying the fixes, we identified a few **remaining issues/improvements** to address. None are fundamental show-stoppers, but resolving them will polish the voice trading experience and enhance reliability. Below is the list of issues with a step-by-step plan for each, all of which are feasible to implement within the next two days:

- **A. Relaxing Strict Function Schemas:** The list_managed_wallets function still requires parameters that need not be provided (since the backend has defaults)[\[10\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/core/tools.js#L525-L533). This rigid schema can cause the model’s calls to be flagged as invalid if it doesn’t fill in default values. To fix this, we will **update the schema in the tool definition** to make these parameters optional. Concretely, in token-ai/core/tools.js, we’ll remove the entire "required": \[...\] list for list_managed_wallets, or at least remove search, limit, offset, include_admin from that list, and set additionalProperties: false only to enforce no extraneous keys. This way, the OpenAI API will accept an empty {} or partial arguments. After making this change, we will test the flow where the assistant calls list_managed_wallets with no arguments (which is likely in a natural conversation) and verify it returns the wallet list without error. This change is straightforward (a one-line edit in the schema definition) and low-risk. We’ll also apply this philosophy to any other tool schemas that have similar patterns (e.g., some of the trading tools have all fields required but with defaults provided – we’ll check if the model might call them without specifying defaults). Adjusting these will prevent any future function_call_error events related to arg validation. **ETA:** 1 day (including testing in the voice UI to ensure no regressions).
- **B. Smoother Token Disambiguation in Trade Context:** As discussed, when a user says “Buy X” and the agent finds multiple tokens named X, the current flow asks the user to pick a token and then inexplicably says “Say 'yes' to start analysis.” From a user’s perspective, this is confusing – they wanted to buy, not run an analysis report. The **issue** is that the disambiguation confirmation isn’t context-aware. The fix is to make it context-aware. We will **modify the checkPendingConfirm() logic in public/js/live/tools.js** to differentiate between an analysis scenario and a trading scenario. How to detect? We can set a flag when the model’s last action was a resolve_token as part of a trade request. For example, if the model’s chain of thought included calling execute_buy but needed a token first, we know the intent is trading. The client could set a flag like pendingTradeConfirm = true when listing candidates in that case. Then, in checkPendingConfirm, when the user selects a token (via number or address snippet), instead of setting pendingConfirm with {address, symbol,...} and always prompting analysis, we do:
- If pendingTradeConfirm is true, we could directly call the preview or execution tool for that token. Or we set a different state that indicates “ready to execute trade”. Perhaps the simplest: modify the spoken prompt to **“Selected \[Token\]. Say 'yes' to** confirm the purchase**, or 'no' to cancel.”** Then, in the code that handles the user’s "yes", instead of calling run_agent (analysis), we call the sequence for trade. We might need to call execute_buy_preview first to adhere to our preview-then-confirm model. So the flow might become: user picks token -> agent says “You chose X, would you like to preview the trade?” -> user says “yes” -> agent (model) calls preview -> model presents preview -> model asks “proceed?” -> user says “yes” -> agent calls execute_buy. This involves both client and model changes.
- However, since we want to minimize client-side logic, another approach: once the user selects the token (say it’s unambiguous now), we could feed that back into the model and let it continue. For instance, we could simulate a user message like “I meant \[Token Name\] token.” But that might confuse things. A cleaner method with minimal changes is: after selection, **reuse the confirmation flow** but point it to trading. E.g., set pendingConfirm = { address, symbol, name, \*\*mode: 'trade'\*\* }. Then in the if (isYes(text)) branch[\[19\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/public/js/live/tools.js#L159-L168), check if pendingConfirm.mode === 'trade'. If so, instead of spawning analysis, we trigger the trade sequence. We might directly call voice.dc.send(... response.create ...) to inject a system instruction to the model: “User confirmed token choice for trading.” Then allow the model to continue (the model knows it wanted to buy, has the mint now, so it should go ahead and call execute_buy or preview next). We could also have the client itself call execute_buy_preview immediately and send the result back (similar to how run_agent was called). But letting the model handle it might be more in line with MCP usage.
- We will implement the above logic carefully and test with a scenario: “Voice: Buy 0.01 SOL of BONK.” BONK has multiple matches likely. The agent lists options. User says “1” (chooses BONK). The agent should then ideally say “Great, shall I proceed to buy BONK?” (instead of analysis). User says “yes.” Then it either goes straight to buy or does a preview then buy. We’ll ensure this flows correctly. This change is a bit more involved than (A) but still mostly front-end JS adjustments and prompt changes – doable in <2 days.
- **C. Ensuring Preview and Confirmation Steps are Never Skipped:** While GPT-4 is pretty good about following the preview-then-confirm instruction, we want to guarantee it by refining the prompts. We will update the **system domain prompt for trading** to explicitly mandate the flow: e.g., _“Always use execute_buy_preview or execute_sell_preview before finalizing a trade. Present the preview outcome to the user and ask for confirmation by saying something like 'Do you want to proceed?'. Only if the user confirms, then call the final execute function.”_ This explicit instruction (which we can place in **Trading Execution Guidelines**[\[35\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/system.domain/trading-execution.md#L21-L28)) will remove any ambiguity. Currently the prompt says “with preview if useful”[\[18\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/token-ai/prompts/realtime.instructions.md#L16-L19) – we will change that to a firm directive. We’ll also mention that if the user has already confirmed (e.g., says “buy it now”), the assistant can skip asking again, but generally confirmation is needed. After updating the prompt, we will run a quick simulation: ask the agent to buy a token (without explicitly asking for a preview). We expect it to still do a preview first. If it does, and then asks “Proceed?”, we consider it a success. This is a prompt-only change (no code), so it’s low-risk and quick to do. Testing will be done via a few voice commands in the staging environment.
- **D. Minor Tool Discoverability Check – resolve_token:** Although the agent handles resolve_token via the MCP mechanism, we want to double-check it never triggers an unknown_tool. In our logs, we didn’t see any unknown_tool error for resolve_token, which means the model’s request was likely recognized as an MCP call. This may be because the system might have a pseudo-tool or because the model’s function call was caught differently. To be absolutely safe, we can **add a stub function definition for resolve_token in the initial session tools** (similar to how other tools are listed). This stub would describe resolve_token as taking a query and returning results. The model already knows to use it from the prompt; listing it formally means the OpenAI API will treat it as a valid function call. The implementation here is to modify the getRealtimeTools() function (or wherever we assemble the list of tools for the session) to include an entry: {name: "resolve_token", description: "Resolve a token name/symbol to a Solana mint address.", parameters: { type: "object", properties: { query: {type:"string"}, limit: {type:"integer"} }, required: \["query"\] } } – basically mirror the schema defined on the server[\[36\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L156-L164)[\[37\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/f8ba98a5544abe639482ce27552eda49180c6a30/token-ai/mcp/tools/trading.mjs#L158-L166). We mark it as a **network/MCP function** perhaps, but since we intercept it in the client, it actually behaves like a local function to the model. Once added, we test by having the user ask “Resolve XYZ token” or by letting the model call it during a trade. It should execute normally (which it currently does), but now with zero risk of being flagged unknown. This is more of a precaution; since things are working we might find it redundant, but it could future-proof changes if OpenAI tightens function call validations. This addition is simple (one JSON object in the tools list) and can be done alongside other prompt/tool-config updates.

Implementing **A, B, C, D** will considerably enhance the voice agent: - (A) and (D) ensure technical robustness (no schema or API hiccups). - (B) and (C) ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience for multi-step trades.

All these changes are attainable within a 48-hour sprint. We will prioritize (B) and (C) first, as they directly affect user interaction, then (A) and (D) which are straightforward config tweaks. By the end of this iteration, the GPT-driven voice agent will not only have all previous issues fixed but will also handle token trading conversations from start to finish in a **reliable, safe, and conversationally natural** manner. The user can speak a request, the agent will handle all the necessary tool calls under the hood, and it will only proceed with irreversible actions (like executing a trade) when appropriately confirmed – all while using the correct context and providing helpful feedback at each step. This aligns perfectly with the best practices for OpenAI’s real-time API usage and the goal of a fully autonomous voice trading assistant.[\[3\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L41-L44)[\[14\]](https://github.com/BranchManager69/dexter/blob/a5d880b25f106b77cc9e8e95f7b518646bdef5b2/FIX_VOICE_AGENT.md#L66-L74)
