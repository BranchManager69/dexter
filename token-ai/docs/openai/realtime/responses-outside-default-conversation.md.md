Create responses outside the default conversation
By default, all responses generated during a session are added to the session's conversation state (the "default conversation"). However, you may want to generate model responses outside the context of the session's default conversation, or have multiple responses generated concurrently. You might also want to have more granular control over which conversation items are considered while the model generates a response (e.g. only the last N number of turns).

Generating "out-of-band" responses which are not added to the default conversation state is possible by setting the response.conversation field to the string none when creating a response with the 
response.create
 client event.

When creating an out-of-band response, you will probably also want some way to identify which server-sent events pertain to this response. You can provide metadata for your model response that will help you identify which response is being generated for this client-sent event.

Create an out-of-band model response
const prompt = `
Analyze the conversation so far. If it is related to support, output
"support". If it is related to sales, output "sales".
`;

const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    // Setting to "none" indicates the response is out of band
    // and will not be added to the default conversation
    conversation: "none",

    // Set metadata to help identify responses sent back from the model
    metadata: { topic: "classification" },
    
    // Set any other available response fields
    modalities: [ "text" ],
    instructions: prompt,
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
Now, when you listen for the 
response.done
 server event, you can identify the result of your out-of-band response.

Create an out-of-band model response
function handleEvent(e) {
  const serverEvent = JSON.parse(e.data);
  if (
    serverEvent.type === "response.done" &&
    serverEvent.response.metadata?.topic === "classification"
  ) {
    // this server event pertained to our OOB model response
    console.log(serverEvent.response.output[0]);
  }
}

// Listen for server messages (WebRTC)
dataChannel.addEventListener("message", handleEvent);

// Listen for server messages (WebSocket)
// ws.on("message", handleEvent);
Create a custom context for responses
You can also construct a custom context that the model will use to generate a response, outside the default/current conversation. This can be done using the input array on a 
response.create
 client event. You can use new inputs, or reference existing input items in the conversation by ID.

Listen for out-of-band model response with custom context
const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    conversation: "none",
    metadata: { topic: "pizza" },
    modalities: [ "text" ],

    // Create a custom input array for this request with whatever context
    // is appropriate
    input: [
      // potentially include existing conversation items:
      {
        type: "item_reference",
        id: "some_conversation_item_id"
      },
      {
        type: "message",
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            type: "input_text",
            text: "Is it okay to put pineapple on pizza?",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
Create responses with no context
You can also insert responses into the default conversation, ignoring all other instructions and context. Do this by setting input to an empty array.

Insert no-context model responses into the default conversation
const prompt = `
Say exactly the following:
I'm a little teapot, short and stout! 
This is my handle, this is my spout!
`;

const event = {
  type: "response.create",
  response: {
    // An empty input array removes existing context
    input: [],
    instructions: prompt,
  },
};

// WebRTC data channel and WebSocket both have .send()
dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
