Error handling
The 
error
 event is emitted by the server whenever an error condition is encountered on the server during the session. Occasionally, these errors can be traced to a client event that was emitted by your application.

Unlike HTTP requests and responses, where a response is implicitly tied to a request from the client, we need to use an event_id property on client events to know when one of them has triggered an error condition on the server. This technique is shown in the code below, where the client attempts to emit an unsupported event type.

const event = {
  event_id: "my_awesome_event",
  type: "scooby.dooby.doo",
};

dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify(event));
This unsuccessful event sent from the client will emit an error event like the following:

{
  "type": "invalid_request_error",
  "code": "invalid_value",
  "message": "Invalid value: 'scooby.dooby.doo' ...",
  "param": "type",
  "event_id": "my_awesome_event"
}
