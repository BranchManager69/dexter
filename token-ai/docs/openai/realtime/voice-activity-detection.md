Voice activity detection
By default, Realtime sessions have voice activity detection (VAD) enabled, which means the API will determine when the user has started or stopped speaking and respond automatically.

Read more about how to configure VAD in our voice activity detection guide.

Disable VAD
VAD can be disabled by setting turn_detection to null with the 
session.update
 client event. This can be useful for interfaces where you would like to take granular control over audio input, like push to talk interfaces.

When VAD is disabled, the client will have to manually emit some additional client events to trigger audio responses:

Manually send 
input_audio_buffer.commit
, which will create a new user input item for the conversation.
Manually send 
response.create
 to trigger an audio response from the model.
Send 
input_audio_buffer.clear
 before beginning a new user input.
Keep VAD, but disable automatic responses
If you would like to keep VAD mode enabled, but would just like to retain the ability to manually decide when a response is generated, you can set turn_detection.interrupt_response and turn_detection.create_response to false with the 
session.update
 client event. This will retain all the behavior of VAD but not automatically create new Responses. Clients can trigger these manually with a 
response.create
 event.

This can be useful for moderation or input validation or RAG patterns, where you're comfortable trading a bit more latency in the interaction for control over inputs.
