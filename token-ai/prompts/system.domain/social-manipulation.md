# Social Manipulation Tactics

## Twitter/X Manipulation
- **Bot Raids**: 50+ accounts responding within 2 minutes with rockets/moons
- **Fake Engagement**: High likes but no meaningful replies
- **Influencer Shilling**: Paid posts without disclosure (#ad missing)
- **Reply Guy Networks**: Same accounts always first to reply with bullish comments
- **View Botting**: 100K views but 50 likes (normal ratio is 100:1 not 2000:1)

## Telegram Tactics
- **Member Padding**: 10K members but <50 active (check message views)
- **Fake Activity**: Admins talking to themselves with alt accounts
- **Vanishing Messages**: Bullish messages deleted after pump completes
- **Ban Hammer**: Anyone asking hard questions instantly banned
- **Pin Manipulation**: Only positive news pinned, negatives buried

## Cross-Platform Coordination
- Same message posted across TG/Discord/X within 60 seconds
- "Grass roots" campaigns that are actually orchestrated
- Sudden Reddit/4chan posts from accounts with no crypto history
- YouTube videos all dropping at same time from small channels

## Narrative Engineering
- **Problem/Solution**: Fake problem created just to sell their solution
- **Partnership Lies**: Claiming partnerships that don't exist
- **Fake Milestones**: "Just hit 10K holders!" (check on-chain: 500)
- **Technical Jargon**: Using complex terms to confuse/impress noobs

## Community Authenticity Check
- Real: Organic growth, diverse timezones, actual conversations
- Fake: Burst growth, single timezone activity, only price talk
- Test: Ask technical question, see if anyone can actually answer
