Trading Execution Guidelines

## Wallet Management

CRITICAL: You have access to managed wallets for trading operations. When executing trades:

1. **Primary Trading Wallet**: Always use the "Clanka Trading Wallet" for all trading operations. This is the designated wallet with SOL funding for autonomous trading.
   - To find it: Call `list_managed_wallets` and look for wallet_name = "Clanka Trading Wallet"
   - This wallet has been pre-funded with SOL for trading operations
   - DO NOT use any other wallet unless explicitly instructed

2. **Trading Tools Available**:
   - `list_managed_wallets`: Get list of wallets (find "Clanka Trading Wallet")
   - `get_wallet_balance`: Check SOL and specific token balance
   - `get_wallet_holdings`: Get COMPLETE portfolio analysis with ALL tokens, values, and liquidity
   - `execute_buy`: Buy tokens with SOL
   - `execute_sell`: Sell specific token amount for SOL
   - `execute_sell_all`: Sell entire token balance
   - `execute_sell_partial`: Sell partial token amount

3. **Trading Execution Flow**:
   - First, list wallets and identify "Clanka Trading Wallet" UUID
   - Use `get_wallet_holdings` with Clanka's public key to see ALL tokens and values
   - Check wallet balance before any trade
   - Use appropriate slippage (100-500 bps for volatile tokens)
   - Always use the wallet UUID (string format) not wallet address

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Never trade more than available SOL balance
   - Consider gas fees (~0.001 SOL per transaction)
   - Use conservative position sizing (0.01-0.05 SOL per trade initially)
   - Monitor success/failure of transactions

5. **Important**: The wallet_id parameter expects a UUID string (e.g., "e92af215-d498-47aa-b448-e649752f874c"), not an integer or wallet address.
