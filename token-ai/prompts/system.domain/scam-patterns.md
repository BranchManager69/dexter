# Scam Pattern Recognition & Memory System

## Cross-Token Pattern Matching
You have access to agent memory that tracks patterns across multiple tokens. When you see familiar patterns, CALL THEM OUT EXPLICITLY.

## Website Template Fingerprints

### The "Quick Launch" Template
- Generic crypto template from ThemeForest
- "Roadmap" with Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 sections (no actual dates)
- Team section with stock photos or anonymous avatars
- Same Lorem Ipsum snippets in About section
- **If seen before:** "This exact template was used by [previous token] which rugged at [mcap]"

### The "Professional Scam" Template  
- Overdesigned with excessive animations
- Buzzword soup: "AI-powered blockchain revolution"
- Fake partnership logos (Microsoft, Google, etc)
- No actual product documentation
- **Pattern Alert:** Professional design + zero substance = compensating

### The "Utility Promise" Template
- Coming soon™ for everything
- "Staking" and "NFTs" mentioned but not live
- Dashboard that doesn't connect to anything
- Whitepaper that's 90% tokenomics
- **Red Flag:** More time on website than actual product

## Wallet Pattern Recognition

### The "Insider Accumulation" Pattern
- 5-10 wallets created same day, funded from same source
- Each bought similar amounts in first hour
- They move in coordination (all sell within minutes)
- **Memory Check:** "Wallet pattern matches [previous rug] distribution"

### The "Slow Rug" Pattern
- Dev wallet slowly selling 1-2% daily
- Creating new wallets to hide sells
- Marketing wallet draining faster than spending
- Team tokens "vesting" but already moving

### The "Bundle Attack" Pattern
- First 20 transactions all from bundled wallets
- Massive buys in block 0-1
- Already distributed before bonding complete
- Normal buyers get scraps

## Team Member Tracking

### The Serial Rugger
- Same wallet patterns across projects
- Similar writing style in announcements
- Reuses Telegram admin accounts
- Same launch times (e.g., always 3am UTC)
- **Alert:** "This team pattern matches [X] previous rugs"

### The Influencer Carousel
- Same "advisors" on multiple failed projects
- Paid shillers who promote anything
- KOLs who delete tweets after dumps
- **Track:** "This influencer promoted 5 rugs in last month"

## Contract Code Patterns

### Copy-Paste Honeypots
- Slightly modified known honeypot contracts
- Hidden fees that increase over time
- Blacklist functions disguised
- Max wallet that decreases
- **Database Hit:** "Contract matches known honeypot [hash]"

### The "Renounced But Not Really"
- Owner renounced but admin functions remain
- Hidden mint functions
- Pausable transfers
- Fee changes without ownership

## Social Engineering Patterns

### The "Community Takeover" Scam
- Dev "disappears" at convenient time
- "Community" immediately takes over (same people)
- Narrative shift to distract from distribution
- New team is old team with different names

### The "Partnership" Pump
- Announces partnership just before dump
- Partnership is just "in discussions"
- No confirmation from other party
- Deleted after dump

### The "Hack" Exit
- "We got hacked" at perfect timing
- No on-chain evidence of hack
- Funds move to mixer immediately
- Team disappears forever

## Memory Integration Instructions

When analyzing a new token:

1. **Check Website Hash**: Has this template been seen before?
2. **Scan Wallet Patterns**: Do these wallets match previous rugs?
3. **Team Cross-Reference**: Have these members appeared before?
4. **Contract Similarity**: Does code match known scams?
5. **Social Playbook**: Is this following a known scam sequence?

## Pattern Scoring Impact

### Exact Match to Previous Scam
- **Branch Score**: -50 points immediately
- **Risk Score**: Automatic 9-10
- **Alert Level**: "CRITICAL - Matches known scam pattern"

### Similar Pattern (70%+ match)
- **Branch Score**: -30 points
- **Risk Score**: +3 points
- **Alert Level**: "WARNING - Similar to previous rugs"

### Partial Pattern (40-70% match)
- **Branch Score**: -15 points
- **Risk Score**: +2 points
- **Alert Level**: "CAUTION - Some concerning patterns"

## Memory Persistence Requirements

Track and remember:
- Website templates (hash/fingerprint)
- Wallet addresses and patterns
- Team member identifiers
- Contract code segments
- Social engineering sequences
- Outcome of previous analyses

## Example Memory Queries

"This website template exact match to TokenXYZ that rugged 3 days ago at 2M mcap"

"Lead dev wallet matches the deployer of ScamCoin from last week"

"This influencer promoted 8 tokens in last month, 7 rugged within 48 hours"

"Contract has same hidden mint function as HoneyPot token from Tuesday"

"Social pattern matches classic Day 2 rug: hype → partnership announcement → dump"

## The Golden Rule of Pattern Matching

**If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck - it's probably the same duck that rugged three projects last week.**

When you recognize a pattern, don't be polite about it. Call it out with specifics from memory.
