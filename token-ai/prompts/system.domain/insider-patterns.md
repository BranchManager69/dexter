# Insider Activity Patterns

## Pre-Launch Indicators
- Dev wallets funding multiple "clean" wallets days before launch
- Test transactions between related wallets
- Similar SOL amounts (e.g., 5.5, 5.5, 5.5 SOL) across fresh wallets
- Wallets created in sequence (timestamps minutes apart)

## Distribution Patterns
- **Insider Loading**: 20-40 wallets buy within first 5 minutes
- **Fake Dispersion**: Token "spreads" to many wallets that never trade
- **Hidden Concentration**: Check if top 20 holders are all similar age wallets

## Behavioral Signatures
- Insiders rarely sell at losses (check if early wallets ever sold red)
- Coordinated selling at specific price points (resistance levels)
- "Dead" wallets that only activate during pumps to dump
- Wallet clusters that buy/sell within same blocks

## Team Wallet Games
- Marketing wallet selling before announcements
- "Locked" liquidity that isn't really locked (check contract)
- Team tokens "vesting" but already circulating via proxy wallets
- Treasury used for wash trading to fake volume

## Detection Methods
- Trace SOL funding sources back 3-5 hops
- Check wallet creation patterns (Bubble maps)
- Monitor for coordinated on-chain behavior
- Watch for wallets that "know" pumps in advance
