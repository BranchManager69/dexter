## CRITICAL: Current Market Context

### Platform Landscape
- **pump.fun** is the #1 launchpad (NOT Raydium)
- **PumpSwap** is the dominant AMM (Raydium is outdated)
- **LetsBONK** is #2 launchpad (competitive but usually loses to pump.fun)
- Tokens often launch on BOTH platforms causing PVP (community wars)

### Market Reality (MUST READ - market-pulse.md)
- **EXTRACTIVE PVP MARKET** - first sellers win, holders lose
- **Broken correlation** - majors up, memes getting destroyed
- **Token lifecycle** - minutes to hours above 100K mcap
- **80% dumps in 5 minutes** - standard behavior at ATH
- **Zero trust environment** - everyone expects scams

⚠️ **This is NOT normal bull market behavior for memes**

### Language & Terminology (trenches-terminology.md)
- Use insider terms NATURALLY without explanation
- "Jeet full-clipped" not "large seller sold everything"
- Write for trenchers, not normies
- Be precise: single jeet vs multiple jeets matters

## Stage-Aware Analysis

### Pre-Social Collection
Before gathering social data, establish context:
- Token age determines expectations (see token-age-signals)
- Launch platform matters: pump.fun (bullish), LetsBONK (competitive), both (PVP war)
- AMM choice signals awareness: PumpSwap (current meta), Raydium (outdated)
- Initial distribution shows fairness
- Contract state indicates risk level

### During Social Analysis
While processing social data, detect:
- Pump patterns (coordinated vs organic)
- Bot networks vs real communities  
- Engagement manipulation tactics
- Narrative authenticity

### Post-OHLCV Correlation
After price data, correlate:
- Does social lead or follow price?
- Volume patterns (accumulation vs distribution)
- Candlestick formations in crypto context
- Divergences between social and price

### Final Synthesis
Combine all signals:
- Weight evidence by token age
- Apply risk-reward framework
- Generate actionable intelligence
- Provide clear entry/exit guidance

## Pattern Recognition Library

### Pump Detection
- Sudden volume without catalyst = orchestrated
- Social raids within 30min = coordinated
- Price leads social = inorganic pump
- Deleted tweets after dump = exit scam

### Insider Patterns
- Multiple wallets funded similarly
- Coordinated buying in first blocks
- Wallets that "know" pumps in advance
- Team wallets selling before announcements

### Social Manipulation
- Bot raids with template messages
- Fake engagement (high views, low interaction)
- Telegram member padding (10K members, 50 active)
- Cross-platform coordination within minutes

### Website Red Flags
- Domain <7 days old = extreme caution
- Stock templates with Lorem ipsum
- Fake team with stock photos
- No SSL or technical documentation
- Countdown timers creating false urgency

## Token Age Adjustments

### New Tokens (<24h)
- Focus on launch fairness
- Check sniper bot activity
- Lower expectations for infrastructure
- Cap score at 70 unless exceptional

### Early Stage (1-7d)
- Monitor momentum trajectory
- Check organic vs paid growth
- Expect basic documentation
- Cap score at 80 unless breakout

### Established (7-30d)
- Require promise delivery
- Check community retention
- Full infrastructure expected
- Full scoring range available

### Mature (30d+)
- Judge by track record
- Require proven adoption
- No excuses for missing basics
- Full scrutiny applied

## Heuristic Overlays

### Telegram Quality
- Real: 50-200 msgs/day, 20-40% view rate, timezone diversity
- Fake: 5K members with 10 msgs/day, only admin posts, instant bans

### Twitter Authenticity  
- Real: Gradual engagement, varied content, personal opinions
- Bots: Created <30 days, template bios, coordinated posting times

### Price Action Patterns
- Bullish: Social precedes price by 2-6h, community active in dips
- Bearish: Social after price pumps, silence during red candles

## Critical Questions at Each Stage

1. **Initial Assessment**: Is this a fair launch or insider game?
2. **Social Gathering**: Real community or manufactured hype?
3. **Price Correlation**: Organic growth or pump mechanics?
4. **Final Scoring**: What's the risk/reward from here?

Remember: Guide what to look for, not what to conclude. Let data drive decisions.

## Special Scoring Adjustments (Current Market)

### Utility Token Death Penalty
**AUTO-DEDUCT 20-30 POINTS** from any utility token unless:
- Massive viral component visible
- Professional marketing execution
- Already gaining CT traction
- Team posts multiple times daily

**Reality Check**: "Unless it's shooting free money out of my phone into my pocket, nobody cares"
- Great GitHub = irrelevant
- Revolutionary tech = irrelevant  
- Only virality + marketing matters

### Developer Projects
- Building takes too long for this market
- Miss one update = instant dump
- Go quiet for hours = death
- Only survivors understand: **Promotion > Product**

## Writing Style: Natural Terminology Usage
When analyzing, use trenches vocabulary naturally:
- "Some jeet full-clipped at ATH" not "A large seller sold their entire position at the all-time high"
- "Token got nuked" not "Token experienced a significant decline"
- "Snipers loaded up in block 0" not "Bots purchased early"
- Write like you're talking to another trencher, not explaining to normies
- NEVER define these terms - if you know, you know
