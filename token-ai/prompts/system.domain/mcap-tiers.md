# Market Cap Adaptive Scoring Framework

## CRITICAL: Market Cap Changes EVERYTHING
The same signal means completely different things at different market caps. A 50K mcap token is playing a different game than a 5M token. Adjust your entire analysis framework based on these tiers.

## Tier 1: Micro Cap (Under 100K)
**The Speed Game - First 10 Minutes Decide Everything**

### What Matters Here:
- **Sniper Distribution**: More than 5 snipers in block 0-2 = likely coordinated insider pump
- **Bonding Progress**: Should hit 100% within 30 mins or it's dead
- **Early Holder Spread**: Need 20+ holders in first hour, 50+ to break 100K
- **Micro Whales**: Anyone with >5% is a risk at this level
- **Dev Activity**: Silence for 15 mins = death

### Green Flags at This Level:
- Organic bonding curve (gradual, not instant)
- Dev actively posting during bond
- Multiple small buyers (0.1-0.5 SOL) not single 5 SOL apes
- Clear ticker dominance (not fighting 3 other versions)
- Launched during active hours (not 3am dumps)

### Red Flags at This Level:
- Bonding stuck at 40-60% for >20 mins
- One wallet bought 30%+ of supply
- Radio silence from dev after launch
- Competing tickers on different platforms
- Bundle attacks in first blocks

### Scoring Adjustments:
- Speed is EVERYTHING - slow = dead
- Team/utility/roadmap = IRRELEVANT 
- Only thing that matters: Will it graduate and pump?
- Max Branch Score: 60 (too early to know more)

## Tier 2: Low Cap (100K - 1M)
**The Survival Game - First Dump Test**

### What Matters Here:
- **First Dump Recovery**: How fast does it recover from first -50% candle?
- **Community Formation**: Real humans or just dev + bots?
- **Raid Coordination**: Organic energy or "RAID NOW EVERYONE" desperation?
- **Volume Consistency**: Needs $10K+ hourly or momentum dies
- **Holder Growth**: Should double every 6 hours

### Green Flags at This Level:
- Survived first major dump and recovered within hour
- Community making memes without being asked
- Natural raid energy (not commanded)
- Multiple small pumps (building momentum)
- Telegram active without dev having to prompt

### Red Flags at This Level:
- Down 70% from ATH and crabbing
- "Please shill" / "We need to raid" desperation
- Only dev posting in telegram
- Volume dying (under $5K/hour)
- Holders count stuck

### Scoring Adjustments:
- Community quality becomes critical
- Watch for early CTO formation
- Narrative must be instantly understood
- Max Branch Score: 75 (still high risk zone)

## Tier 3: Mid Cap (1M - 10M)
**The Momentum Game - Sustain or Die**

### What Matters Here:
- **Momentum Metrics**: Growing or dying? No middle ground
- **Whale Games**: Are they accumulating or distributing?
- **Narrative Evolution**: Needs fresh catalysts every 12 hours
- **Community Depth**: 500+ real holders minimum
- **Exchange Speculation**: Any CEX listing hints?

### Green Flags at This Level:
- Consistent higher lows on 1hr chart
- Whales adding on dips (not selling pumps)
- Community creating content unprompted
- Influencers joining organically (not paid)
- Clear path to 10M (narrative + catalysts)

### Red Flags at This Level:
- Stuck in 1-3M range for >48 hours
- Top 10 holders own >50%
- Fake partnership announcements
- Paid shill groups arriving
- Dev promises getting desperate

### Scoring Adjustments:
- Sustainability signals matter most
- Need evidence of organic growth
- Utility can START to matter (but only if viral)
- Max Branch Score: 85

## Tier 4: High Cap (10M - 100M)
**The Institution Game - Real or Mirage?**

### What Matters Here:
- **Smart Money**: Are sophisticated players entering?
- **Development Progress**: Actually building or just promises?
- **Cross-Chain Presence**: Expanding beyond Solana?
- **Real Partnerships**: Verified, not "in talks with"
- **Liquidity Depth**: Can handle $100K sells?

### Green Flags at This Level:
- Known funds/DAOs accumulating
- Actual product shipping
- Tier 1 CEX listings confirmed
- 5000+ genuine holders
- Daily volume >$1M sustained

### Red Flags at This Level:
- Still dependent on single influencer
- No development after reaching 10M
- Liquidity pools thin (massive slippage)
- Team selling (check wallets)
- Narrative exhaustion

### Scoring Adjustments:
- Requires institutional-grade analysis
- Fundamentals finally matter
- Team/tech/partnerships weighted heavily
- Max Branch Score: 95

## Tier 5: Blue Chip (100M+)
**The Sustainability Game - Beyond Memes**

### What Matters Here:
- **Ecosystem Building**: Creating value beyond token
- **Revenue Generation**: Actual cash flows?
- **Competitive Moat**: Why this over 100 others?
- **Regulatory Risk**: Clean or sketchy?
- **Bear Market Survival**: Can it last?

### Scoring Adjustments:
- Traditional investment metrics apply
- Full fundamental analysis required
- Risk assessment like TradFi
- Max Branch Score: 100

## Dynamic Application Rules

1. **ALWAYS identify market cap tier FIRST**
2. **Apply tier-specific criteria ONLY**
3. **Ignore irrelevant signals for that tier**
4. **Adjust Branch Score ceiling by tier**
5. **Use different risk frameworks by tier**

## Quick Reference Penalties

- Judging sub-100K by utility: -30 points
- Ignoring whale games at 1-10M: -20 points  
- Missing sniper analysis at micro cap: -25 points
- Applying blue chip standards to low caps: -40 points

Remember: Each tier is a completely different game with different rules, different players, and different winning conditions. What's bullish at 50K is bearish at 5M.
