# Time Decay Sentiment Weighting

## The Reality: In Crypto, 3 Hours Ago Is Ancient History

Social sentiment expires faster than milk in this market. A bullish tweet from yesterday might as well be from last year. Weight ALL social signals by their age.

## Time Decay Multipliers

### Last Hour (0-60 minutes ago)
**Weight: 1.0x - FULL SIGNAL STRENGTH**
- This is the ONLY timeframe that truly matters
- These tweets/messages are actively influencing price RIGHT NOW
- Raid calls in this window are still active
- Community energy here = current reality

### Recent (1-6 hours ago)  
**Weight: 0.7x - SIGNIFICANT BUT FADING**
- Still relevant but momentum may have shifted
- Check if sentiment was FOLLOWED by price action
- If no price response in 6 hours, sentiment failed
- Good for confirming sustained interest vs one-time spike

### Yesterday (6-24 hours ago)
**Weight: 0.3x - HISTORICAL CONTEXT ONLY**
- Only useful for pattern detection
- "They pumped this yesterday too" type signals
- Helps identify pump/dump cycles
- Cannot drive current decision making

### Ancient History (24+ hours ago)
**Weight: 0.1x - NEARLY WORTHLESS**
- Only include if showing consistent pattern
- "They've been building for 3 days" still worth noting
- Individual tweets/raids from here = ignore
- Exception: Major news that hasn't been acted on yet

## Application by Signal Type

### Raid Campaigns
- Active raid (last hour): CRITICAL SIGNAL
- Raid 3 hours ago: Check if it worked (price pump?)
- Raid 6+ hours ago: Irrelevant unless pattern
- Multiple raids over 24h: Shows desperation

### Influencer Posts
- Big influencer last hour: IMMEDIATE CATALYST
- Influencer 2-4 hours ago: Did it pump? Already priced in?
- Influencer yesterday: Old news, find new catalyst
- Exception: If influencer keeps doubling down

### Community Activity
- Current Telegram activity: Real-time sentiment
- Messages from 3+ hours ago: Archaeological dig
- Daily message count: Use 6-hour rolling window
- "Please shill" from 8 hours ago: They already lost

### Developer Updates
- Dev post last 30 mins: Active and engaged
- Dev post 2 hours ago: Still recent enough
- Dev silent for 6+ hours: Warning sign
- Dev silent for 24+ hours: Probably abandoned

## Price Correlation Windows

### Lead Indicators (Social → Price)
- 0-15 minutes: Immediate reaction expected
- 15-45 minutes: Typical absorption time
- 45-90 minutes: Slow market response
- 90+ minutes: Probably won't happen

### Lag Indicators (Price → Social)
- Pump → Tweet storm: Usually within 5 minutes
- Dump → Cope posts: Immediate
- Consolidation → Silence: After 2-3 hours
- Death → "Community takeover": 6-12 hours

## Practical Scoring Examples

### Scenario 1: Token at 500K mcap
- 50 tweets in last hour → Weight: 50 x 1.0 = 50 signal points
- 100 tweets from 4 hours ago → Weight: 100 x 0.7 = 70 signal points
- 200 tweets from yesterday → Weight: 200 x 0.3 = 60 signal points
- **Recent burst (50) matters almost as much as yesterday's campaign (60)**

### Scenario 2: Influencer Shills
- Ansem tweet 20 minutes ago → 100 points x 1.0 = 100 (BUY NOW)
- Ansem tweet 3 hours ago → 100 points x 0.7 = 70 (check if pumped already)
- Ansem tweet yesterday → 100 points x 0.3 = 30 (old news, priced in)

### Scenario 3: Dev Activity
- Dev posting now → Bullish, engaged
- Dev posted 2 hours ago → Neutral, acceptable
- Dev last seen 8 hours ago → Bearish, concerning
- Dev gone for 24 hours → Dead project walking

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS timestamp every social signal**
2. **Weight recent activity 10x more than old**
3. **Check if old signals already played out**
4. **Rapid decay for raid/shill campaigns**
5. **Slower decay for development updates**

## Red Flag Patterns

- "Amazing community!" posts all from 12+ hours ago
- Telegram pinned message from 3 days ago
- Last influencer mention was last week
- Website says "update coming soon" for 48+ hours
- All bullish tweets are from same 6-hour window yesterday

## The Golden Rule

**If the bullish case relies on social signals older than 6 hours, there IS no bullish case.**

In this market, momentum is everything. Old momentum is no momentum.
