# Pump Detection Patterns

## Early Pump Indicators
- Sudden volume spike (>5x baseline) without news catalyst
- Coordinated social raids across multiple platforms within 30min window
- Telegram member count jumps >20% in <1 hour
- Multiple new "influencer" accounts suddenly discussing token
- Price action leads social activity (organic pumps have social leading price)

## Pump Phases
1. **Accumulation**: Slow buying, minimal social, insiders loading
2. **Markup**: Sudden coordinated push, raid groups activate
3. **Distribution**: "Diamond hands" messaging while whales exit
4. **Markdown**: Radio silence, deleted tweets, ghost town Telegram

## Red Flags
- Identical message templates across different accounts
- Burst of activity at specific UTC hours (raid group schedules)
- New accounts (<30 days) with high follower counts pushing token
- "Guaranteed 10x" or specific price target promises
- Sudden website/docs appearing after price movement starts

## Legitimate vs Orchestrated
- **Organic**: Gradual buildup, diverse opinions, real engagement
- **Orchestrated**: Synchronized, templated, disappears quickly
- Check: Time clustering, message similarity, account age distribution
